1. To check if git is installed in your system type "git --version" in terminal/cmd. <br>
2. "git status" to check the status of your repository.<br>
3. untracked(git doesn't track), modified(changed), unmodified, staged(ready to commit).<br>
4. we need to add the file to get them staged. "git add <-file name->" <br> 
5. commit to record change. "git commit -m "some message" "<br>
6. "git add . " to add all the files.<br>
